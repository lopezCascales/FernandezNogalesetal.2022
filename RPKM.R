# Shows a single chart, for each gene, comparing Gene Expression Ratio (Sample vs Universal Human Reference) 
# vs Gene Expression (Log2(RPKM + 0.1)). 
# A value of 0.1 has been added to every RPKM value in order to log the data and account for potential values of 0. 


# https://www.biostars.org/p/108397/
# The fold-change is just their ratio. So if you have an RPKM of 5 in one sample and 2 in another, 
# then the fold change is 5/2 =2.5 (or 2/5=0.4, depending on which sample you'd want things relative to). 
# If wanted log2 foldchanges, then just log2 transform and subtract
